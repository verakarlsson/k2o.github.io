how leisure always imitates labor (2023)
<br>
performance and installation concived by K2o
<br>
<br>
“how leisure always imitates labor” inspects the instituted properties of marriage through plays of imitation/substitution.
<br> 
Glancing at its attempt to decorate labor as leisure in the name of (possessive) love and (naturalized) mirages of the “Self”
<br>
the piece emphasizes the surplus created through such open-secret embellishments.
<br>
Shells, fountains, and pleasure houses are symbols of the baroque architecture in Munich's Hofgarten. Focusing on this 
<br>
historical continuation, “how leisure always imitates labor” re-appropriates the garden as a scenery for the German tragic 
<br>
drama or Trauerspiel. It intently suspends modes of establishing and relinquishing the genre’s origin myth, remaining 
<br>
concerned with a shared un-realization of opulent violence as a form of colonial (dis)possession. 
<br>
The figures of the Trauerspiel exhaust and overcome themselves in the final scene: from reenacting twosomes to self-abolition.

[They] dissect the garden’s political theatre [and]
<br> 
work with spatial memory to construct an inverted 
<br>
image of matrimony. In marriage, partners become
<br> 
familiarised as othered subjects. One becomes
<br> 
possessed, possesses the other. The folding of
<br> 
subjects into one another is expressed materially
<br> 
through the layering of garments and cloth that adorn
<br>
the players. Their work is informed by everyday
<br> 
paradigms of performance, merging the quotidian and
<br> 
the patriarchal frameworks that oversee institutional
<br> 
coupling as a natural part of human life.
