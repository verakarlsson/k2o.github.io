how leisure always imitates labor (2023)
<br>
performance and installation concived by K2o
<br>
<br>
When an institution and infrastructure couple, a “bond for life” is formed, finding its materialization in the celebratory event of marriage. 
<br>
The new performance supposes the co-presence of leisure and labor within this union— both contain and mirror one another through plays of imitation/substitution.
<br> 
As a spatial witness, the Hofgarten conveys a popular scene for wedding photography. It is often utilized as a stage to enact the holy union of wedlock, 
<br>
ensuring sentimental documentation and material perpetuation. Consequently, the performance uses the site to inspect the instituted properties of marriage, 
<br>
glancing at its attempt to decorate labor as leisure in the name of (possessive) love and (naturalized) mirages of the “self.” 
<br>
Shells, fountains, and pleasure houses are symbols of the baroque architecture in the Hofgarten. Focusing on this historical continuation, the piece re-appropriates
<br>
the garden as a scenery for the German tragic drama or Trauer-spiel . It intently suspends modes of establishing and relinquishing the genre, remaining 
<br>
concerned with a shared un-realization of opulent violence as a form of (dis)possession. The figures of the Trauerspiel exhaust and overcome themselves in the 
<br>
final scene: from reenacting twosomes to self-abolition. 
<br>
The Baroque endlessly creates folds. Material and water run fold upon fold, signalizing the infinity of desire, decoration, and the irrepressible feminine flow. 
<br>
In the piece, the ornament, through abundance, dares to mobilize instances of opulent violence and its historicization in the tragic drama for its own measures: 
<br>
Emancipating adornment from the colonial interpretation of the “useless,” the ornament inverts foldedness or com- plicity until ultimately detaching itself from its
<br>
own intensity—setting itself free via transient substitution. By directing the inherent violence of transcendence against itself, the apparatus loses its power. 
<br>
Being concerned with the surplus created through such open-secret embellishments, the performance finally suspects leisure as ornamentality, folding in infinite 
<br>
representation. how leisure always imitates labor thus examines performance as spectacle, disorganization, and collapse.

[They] dissect the garden’s political theatre [and]
<br> 
work with spatial memory to construct an inverted 
<br>
image of matrimony. In marriage, partners become
<br> 
familiarised as othered subjects. One becomes
<br> 
possessed, possesses the other. The folding of
<br> 
subjects into one another is expressed materially
<br> 
through the layering of garments and cloth that adorn
<br>
the players. Their work is informed by everyday
<br> 
paradigms of performance, merging the quotidian and
<br> 
the patriarchal frameworks that oversee institutional
<br> 
coupling as a natural part of human life.
