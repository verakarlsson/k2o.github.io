    how leisure always imitates labor (2023)
    performance and installation
    
    “how leisure always imitates labor” inspects the instituted properties of marriage through plays of imitation/substitution. Glancing at its attempt to decorate labor as leisure in the name of (possessive) love and (naturalized) mirages of the “Self,” the piece emphasizes the surplus created through such open-secret embellishments.
    
    Shells, fountains, and pleasure houses are symbols of the baroque architecture in Munich's Hofgarten. Focusing on this historical continuation, “how leisure always imitates labor” re-appropriates the garden as a scenery for the German tragic drama or Trauerspiel. It intently suspends modes of establishing and relinquishing the genre’s origin myth, remaining concerned with a shared un-realization of opulent violence as a form of colonial (dis)possession.
    
    The figures of the Trauerspiel exhaust and overcome themselves in the final scene: from reenacting twosomes to self-abolition.
